# Day 67 Task | Cohort 2.0

This repository contains the work completed as part of **Day 67** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
The focus of this day was to understand **React fundamentals without JSX**, building UI using `React.createElement()`, and structuring components cleanly using plain JavaScript.

## 🖼️ Design Comparison

| 🖼️ Visual Section | Right-side image-based layout |
| 📱 Responsive Layout | Flexbox-based structure |
| 🗂️ Asset Usage | Local images used via CSS |


## ✨ Key Learning Highlights

You learned to:
- Build React apps without JSX  
- Understand how JSX translates to `React.createElement()`  
- Structure components in separate files  
- Maintain clean and simple ID naming  
- Apply CSS efficiently to React-rendered elements
